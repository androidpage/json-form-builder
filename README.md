# json-form-builder
This is a React component which will build a form from a JSON definition. Basically I got sick of writing complex forms in standard React with change event bindings etc. as I felt like I was perpetually repeating myself. This is the result of my laziness ;)

Note: This is the very first, largely unfinished version. There is no testing to speak of and lots of features I would like to implement. The core functionality does work but there's a lot left to do.
